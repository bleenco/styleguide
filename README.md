# Bleenco Styleguide For Developers

Note: This styleguide is not an exhaustive list of rules and processes. It is rather an emerging repository of habits that have proven to be something called "good software engineering practices". This repository can be modified at any time without any prior notification, if you want to stay on top of it please hit the star and follow updates.

The aim of this styleguide is to:
* inform guests on processes within Bleenco development team,
* brief new candidates and encourage them to submit their first pull request,
* remind current contributors what quality standard do we stand for.

Here you can find the table of contents, code samples and presentations, but the content itself is going to be drafted in a wiki section of this repository.
